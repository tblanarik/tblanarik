[:evergreen_tree:](https://ki7hsg.com) Hey there, I'm Trevor and I manage a team in GitHub's Billing organization.

I've got a background in A/B testing and experimentation, which I'm quite passionate about, and I've also spent a good part of my career doing aircraft manufacturing automation/optimization. I also enjoy helping engineers find the right mentor for them in the company, as well as being a mentor myself.

Outside of work, I'm a husband, father, hiker, and ham radio operator.
