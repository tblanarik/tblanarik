I currently work for GitHub, and previously worked at Microsoft and Boeing.

I've spent most of my time developing in C#, Python, and C++, and my interests/past projects include:

- A/B testing / experiment quality debugging
- geometry/flat patterns/shape nesting
- routing/path planning
- traffic predictions
- genetic algorithms/optimization
