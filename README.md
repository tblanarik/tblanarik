Hey, I'm Trevor! I'm a software engineer at GitHub.

I've spent most of my time developing in C#, Python, and C++, and my interests/past projects include:

- A/B testing / experiment quality debugging
- geometry / flat patterns / shape nesting
- routing / path planning
- traffic predictions
- genetic algorithms / optimization
